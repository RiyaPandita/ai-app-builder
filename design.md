# AI Web App Generator - Solution Design

## Architecture Diagram

```
[User] → [Streamlit Frontend] → [Gemini API] → [Generated Static Web App]

           [Live Preview in Browser Frame]
```

- **Frontend:** Streamlit (Python)
- **AI Layer:** Gemini API for code generation
- **Generated Apps:** Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Preview:** Python's built-in HTTP server

## Flow
1. User describes their desired web app
2. Streamlit sends the description to Gemini API
3. Gemini generates complete HTML/CSS/JS code
4. App starts a local server to preview the generated app
5. User can test in preview or open in new tab

## Component Design & Stack Choices
- **Streamlit:** Clean UI for app generation and preview
- **Gemini API:** Generates complete, self-contained web apps
- **Static Web Apps:** Pure HTML/CSS/JS for simplicity
- **Local Preview:** Python's HTTP server for instant testing

## Generated App Features
- Single HTML file with embedded CSS/JS
- No external dependencies or frameworks
- Client-side storage using localStorage
- Responsive design for all devices
- Modern HTML5 and CSS3 features

## Prompt Engineering
**Template Format:**
"Create a web app that [description] using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"

**Examples:**
- "Create a todo list app where users can add and remove tasks"
- "Create a calculator with a clean modern design"
- "Create a notes app that saves to localStorage"

## Trade-offs & Choices
- **Static Web Apps:** Simple but limited to client-side features
- **No Backend:** Makes apps portable but limits functionality
- **Single File:** Easy to share but could be harder to maintain
- **localStorage:** Simple persistence but limited storage

## Next Steps
- Add more example templates
- Support for progressive web apps (PWA)
- Export functionality for downloading apps
- Gallery of common app templates
